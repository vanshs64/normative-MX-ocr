I would like to express my interest in applying for the internship position in engineering
within Turkney Modular.
I am currently pursuing my Bachelor degree in Mechatronics Engineering at Waterloo
University. I have developed a strong foundation in engineering principles, along with
hands-on experience in robotics and project management.
During my academic journey, I have successfully led projects such as the Tic-Tac-Toe Robot,
where I designed and programmed a robot using the LEGO EV3 platform. This required not
only technical skills in programming and design but also a collaborative spirit as I engaged in
ideation and iterative testing. Additionally, my involvement with Waterloo Formula Electric
has fortified my capabilities in cross-disciplinary teamwork, allowing me to communicate
effectively with engineers from various specialties, a quality I understand is vital for success
as an Engineer. I am eager to bring my design skills, adaptability, and resourcefulness to the
team.
I am very enthusiastic, motivated, and have a relentless work ethic. I have a great amount of
energy, insight, and natural leadership ability that cannot be matched by other candidates. If
given the opportunity, I promise you success and achievement. Thank you in advance for
your consideration.
Sincerely,
Shilo Jeyarajasingam
